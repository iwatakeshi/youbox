# youbox
A minimal clone of YouTube using Vue.js, YouTube API, and Bulma.

## Usage

You'll need an API key from Youtube. Once you have the key, create a `.env` file and add the key as the following:

```
VUE_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY= {{ API_KEY_HERE }}
```

Finally launch the app:

```bash
yarn && yarn serve
```
